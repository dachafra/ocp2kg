# Ontology Change Propagation to Knowledge Graphs (OCP2KG)
OCP2KG is a tool for propagating ontology changes to declarative mappings. The tool requires as input the updated version of the ontology, the outdated mappings, and the change data. The change data has to be in RDF following the [OWL Change Ontology Extension](https://github.com/DiegoCondeHerreros/OWLChangeExtension) model. For usage the parameters have to be modified within code by changing the path of the "file_data", "file_mapping", and "ontology" to the path of the files on your computer. The "updated_mappings.ttl" output is generated in the src folder with the updated mappings for the newer version of the ontology. More details regarding the implementation and evaluation of the tool ca be seen in "Propagating Ontology Changes to Declarative
Mappings in Construction of Knowledge Graphs".
